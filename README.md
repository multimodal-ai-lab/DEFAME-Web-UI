# Web User Interface for DEFAME

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-EC6500?style=for-the-badge&logo=bookstack&logoColor=white)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10510)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-F5A300?style=for-the-badge)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This repository provides the web interface for [DEFAME](https://github.com/multimodal-ai-lab/DEFAME), an **automated fact-checking system**. The UI supports the input of textual _and_ visual content. It decomposes the input into manageable claims. All fact-checks are saved and can be retrieved later, renamed, or deleted.

As of now, our hosted web interface is **not public**, but you can [host it yourself](#usage).

This repository is the result of a student team project at the [Multimodal AI Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/mai/multimodal_ai/index.en.jsp).

## üìÇ Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `client/` contains the frontend implementation, executed in the user's browser.
- `server/` contains the backend, managing the API calls to DEFAME and hosting a database to cache and provide the results.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Deploy [DEFAME's API](https://github.com/multimodal-ai-lab/DEFAME#API).
2. Update the `server/.env` file with the correct `AI_API_URL` (the link pointing at DEFAME's API).
2. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
3. Simply run
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
   and Docker will handle the rest for you.
4. Access the UI at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
